	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>I'm Akshob and welcome to my food blog.</p>
	<p>
		This journey started with: How do I get 6-pack (abs) on a vegetarian diet? Curd rice is my favourite (you know, the one they serve in Indian temples). So, what should be my diet without giving up food that I love? Especially rice and curd.
	</p>
	<p>
		It turns out you don't need to stop eating rice or curd altogether (well, you do need to change something, more on that later).<br/>
		<b>Moderation</b> is the key!<br/>
		Abs are made in the kitchen, but revealed in the gym. It is 80% diet, 20% workout.

		There are a lot of ways to track what you eat. One widely used way is to count calories. If you want to lose weight, eat less calories. If you want to gain weight, eat more calories. But I don't exactly want to just lose weight. I want to lose fat but I want to keep/increase my muscle strength. That is when I stumbled into <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://renaissanceperiodization.com">RP</a>. You essentially count the macros (Protien/Carbohydrate/Fat) each meal instead of overall calories, and this is a science which is a whole new topic by itself.

		Being a vegetarian, there weren't much options available. So I had to build my recipes from scratch. I grew up in Bengaluru, India and learned to cook from my parents. This helped knowing what I eat, so I could count my macros. Remember when I spoke about moderation? You don't really have to stop eating rice. But you do need to reduce the proportion of carbs (and switch to brown rice or wheat as the source), and increase the proportion of protein. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://usa.fage/products/yogurt/fage-total-0">0% fat greek yogurt</a> from Fage is my new favourite now.
	</p>
	<p>
		So, did I achieve my goal? I sorta did, only for a short period of time. It was very hard to maintain. I've been eating out of proportions my entire life. So it is kinda hard to keep up with the new routine. But I did learn a lot about my body and the food I eat.
