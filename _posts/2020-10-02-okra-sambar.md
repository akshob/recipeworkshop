Okra, known as ladies' finger in many english-speaking countries, is rich in dietery fiber, vitamin C and vitamin K. Vegetables and pigeon peas are cooked together in traditional sambar. okra makes the sambar slimy if you cook it with pigeon peas. So the key is to saute the okra till it no longer is sticky!
